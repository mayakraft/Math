# Math for origami

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robbykraft/Math.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robbykraft/Math)

This is the math engine for an [origami library](https://rabbitear.org). It has no dependencies, and it's small. It includes basic linear algebra, geometric intersections with an inclusive or exclusive epsilon, and a few other computational geometry related things.

## usage

This library is bundled into one file, available in a few formats. Use these as a CDN:

UMD

```
https://robbykraft.github.io/Math/math.js
```

ES6

```
https://robbykraft.github.io/Math/math.module.js
```

This library is also included in [Rabbit Ear](https://github.com/robbykraft/Origami).

## examples

Examples can be found in the [Rabbit Ear documentation](https://rabbitear.org/book/math.html)
